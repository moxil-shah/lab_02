1. Using the socket method socket module, you can create a TCP socket in a user-defined function.
The method takes in two arguments, the AddressFamily and SocketKind (aka TCP connection).

2. The server socket must bind the port with the host address while the client socket does not 
as it is the one that sends the data and inits the connection.

3. By using the socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
method.

4. We get the IP address of the client and the port of the request.

5. The data in its entirety in bytes.
